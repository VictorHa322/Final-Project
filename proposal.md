# Final-Project
Description - I plan to create a program that will either be a game or tool that incorporates my passion for arts and food! A little bizarre but as a foodie through and through I would love to find a way to make this project work. I hope I can create a small game where you play in a little restaurant, but that's if I can figure out that out. My second idea was to create a tool that can help artist pull up references for food, but the concept is too broad so I will further change my ideas as I create this project. 

Features - The game will play similar to diner dash where you play as the waiter. If I go with the tools plan, it will feature buttons and a text box that will ask the user what kind of reference they're interested in finding. 

Challenges - I will absolutely have to find tutorials to create games as I'm unsure how to create them on my own. Creating tools and other such will be just as hard for me so I plan on researching the python library to see what is in store. 

Outcomes - 
  a.) Ideal Outcome: Ideally, I hope I can create the game as that sounds fun and interesting to learn! The game would have no bugs in it and look appealing to the player as I wish to go for a pixel artstyle. 
  b.) Minimal Viable Outcome: If the game ends up being too hard, I hope I can create the tool in replacement as I'm unsure of my skills in coding. I hope it would display reference images to the user when asked, but include other insights the user may need assistance with.
  
Milestones - My goals for each week is to create anything that is functioning near of every Friday, and reserve the weekends to debug and fix any issues with my code. I assume it will take me more time and effort to create anything I listed as I'm unsure of my skill level,
but I hope I can create the assets needed for the game.
